#
# Deploy a static-exported Next.js site (built with pnpm) to GitHub Pages
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Builds the site with `pnpm run build` (must produce static files in ./out)
# 2. Uploads that folder as a Pages artifact
# 3. Deploys to the repository’s GitHub Pages site
#
# Prerequisites:
#   • next.config.js should contain `output: 'export'`
#   • A script `"build": "next build && next export"` (or similar) must exist
#     and output to the default ./out directory
#   • In repo Settings → Pages, set “Source” to “GitHub Actions”
#   • This workflow lives at .github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml
